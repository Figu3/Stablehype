            Peg reference rates for non-USD stablecoins (EUR, GBP, CHF, gold, etc.) are derived from the median price
            of stablecoins in each peg group with over $1M supply. For thin groups with fewer than 3 coins, rates are validated against
            live FX data from the European Central Bank (refreshed every 2 hours) to prevent a single depegged coin from skewing the reference.

          <p>
            To reduce false depeg alerts from single-source API glitches, Pharos cross-validates primary prices
            (from DefiLlama) against <span className="text-foreground font-medium">DEX-implied prices</span> derived
            from Curve StableSwap pools. This data comes at zero additional API cost — Curve pool data is already
            fetched every <span className="font-mono">10 minutes</span> for the liquidity score, and each pool
            response includes per-token USD prices.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground font-medium pt-1">How It Works</p>

              <span className="text-foreground font-medium shrink-0">Price Extraction</span>
              <span>
                For each Curve pool with at least $50K TVL and a balance ratio above 0.3, the on-chain USD price
                of each tracked stablecoin is recorded along with the pool&apos;s TVL.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-2">
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium shrink-0">TVL-Weighted Median</span>
              <span>
                Multiple price observations per stablecoin are aggregated using a TVL-weighted median — more robust
                than a weighted mean, since a single high-TVL pool with a distorted price won&apos;t skew the result.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-2">
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium shrink-0">Confirmation Gate</span>
              <span>
                When the primary price suggests a depeg (&ge;1% deviation), the system checks whether the DEX price
                agrees. If the DEX price is fresh (under 20 minutes old) and shows the coin at peg, the depeg event
                is <span className="text-foreground font-medium">suppressed</span> — likely a false positive from
                a single-source glitch. If both sources agree on the depeg, the event opens normally.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Stablecoins without Curve pool presence (~80 of {TRACKED_STABLECOINS.length}) are unaffected — the system
            falls back to primary-price-only detection. The DEX-implied price, deviation, and contributing pools are
            visible on each stablecoin&apos;s detail page and in the peg heatmap.
